# Lung Cancer Prediction using Machine Learning

## Overview

Predicting lung cancer using machine learning involves several steps. Below is a simplified guide:

## 1. Data Collection

### Objective
Obtain a dataset with patient information, including demographics and medical history.

### Actions
1. Identify reliable sources for medical data.
2. Ensure the dataset includes relevant features.
3. Obtain labeled instances indicating lung cancer presence.

## 2. Data Preprocessing

### Objective
Prepare the dataset for machine learning.

### Actions
1. Handle missing data.
2. Convert categorical variables using one-hot encoding.
3. Normalize or standardize numerical features.
4. Identify and handle outliers.

## 3. Feature Extraction

### Objective
Extract relevant features for predicting lung cancer.

### Actions
1. Identify important features.
2. Extract features like demographic information and medical history.

## 4. Feature Selection
